Import the necessary modules:

from alltrails import Client
from geopy.geocoders import Nominatim
Create a new endpoint in the Flask app that takes in the user's fitness level and location as input:

@app.route("/suggested_trails", methods=["POST"])
def suggested_trails():
    # Get the user's fitness level and location from the request
    fitness_level = request.form.get("fitness_level")
    location = request.form.get("location")

    # Use geocoding to convert the location to latitude and longitude
    geolocator = Nominatim(user_agent="my_app")
    location = geolocator.geocode(location)
    latitude = location.latitude
    longitude = location.longitude

    # Use the AllTrails API to get a list of nearby trails based on the user's fitness level
    client = Client(api_key="your_api_key_here")
    trails = client.get_trails_by_coordinates(latitude, longitude, max_distance=10, max_results=10, min_difficulty=fitness_level)

    # Format the response as a JSON object and return it
    response = [{"name": trail.name, "location": trail.location, "difficulty": trail.difficulty} for trail in trails]
    return jsonify(response)
Update the get_bot_response function to handle the new endpoint:

elif 'suggest trails' in user_response:
    # Call the suggested_trails endpoint to get a list of suggested hiking trails
    response = requests.post('http://localhost:5000/suggested_trails', data={'fitness_level': user_info['preferences']['fitness_level'], 'location': user_info['travel_dates']['to']})
    suggested_trails = response.json()

    # Add code to display the suggested trails to the user
