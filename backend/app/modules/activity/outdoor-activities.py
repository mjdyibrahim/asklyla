def get_outdoor_activities(preferences, location):

You can then call this function in the get_bot_response() function, after retrieving the user's preferences and location, and include the suggested activities in the AI's response to the user. Here's an example of how this could be done:

activity_type = request.form.get("activity_type")
location = f"{travel_to}, {travel_from}"
suggested_activities = get_outdoor_activities(activity_type, location)

user_info = {
    "name": name,
    "contact_info": email,
    "travel_dates": {"from": travel_from, "to": travel_to},
    "preferences": {"accommodation_type": accommodation_type, "food_type": food_type, "activity_type": activity_type, "transportation_type": transportation_type},
    "itinerary": []
}

if suggested_activities:
    activity_list = ", ".join(suggested_activities)
    ai_response = f"Based on your preferences and location, I suggest the following outdoor recreational activities: {activity_list}."
else:
    ai_response = "I'm sorry, I couldn't find any outdoor recreational activities that match your preferences and location."

previous_response = {"user": user_response, "assistant": ai_response}
previous_responses.append(previous_response)

return jsonify({"message": ai_response})
