#The code above defines a function get_events that takes a location and a list of interests as input and returns a list of events that match the user's criteria using the Eventbrite API. The function is then called in the get_bot_response function to retrieve the events and add them to the user's itinerary.

#To use this feature, you would need to add a new section to the HTML form to allow the user to select their interests and location, and modify the code in the get_bot_response function to retrieve these values from the form. You would also need to obtain an Eventbrite API key and replace YOUR_EVENTBRITE_API_KEY with your actual API key.
